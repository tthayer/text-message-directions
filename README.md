If you don't have a smart phone, or if you do and you are low on data, feel free to get directions by doing the following:

Send a text message to 1 (312) 313-1234 in the form of "[mode] from [origin] to [destination]". For example, you can text "drive from UC berkeley to Oakland airport". The possible modes of transportation are 'drive', 'walk', 'bike', and 'transit'.

You can also get the phone number and address of a businesse by sending (for example) "info for berkeley public library".

Lastly, you can get up to 20 nearby places with 'find [type of place] near [specific place]'. For example: 'find grocery near uc berkeley'

This project costs money every time it sends or receives a text message. If you'd like to help the project keep running, feel free to donate here:
